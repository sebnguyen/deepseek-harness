# guard/ — loop-hygiene guard family

## Summary

The `guard/` group keeps the agent loop productive by watching for common failure patterns. `repeat-tool-reminder` notices when the model repeats the exact same tool call and reminds it to change approach or finish, so a stuck loop stops burning time and tokens. `timeout-policy` puts a time limit on tool calls that declare one, so a hung call returns a clear timed-out error to the model instead of stalling the session. `staged-escalation` names an explore-then-act phase split in every turn and denies act-stage tools at the decision point until turn-local evidence lands, so a turn cannot spend its writes on unverified premises. All three ship enabled in the `dsh` base bundle; a composition can tune or remove them.

## Packages

The plugins each cover one pattern; each README below explains when to keep, tune, or remove it.

| Package | What it provides |
|---|---|
| [`repeat-tool-reminder/`](repeat-tool-reminder/README.md) | Reminds the model when it repeats the same tool call, so it changes approach or finishes |
| [`staged-escalation/`](staged-escalation/README.md) | Per-turn explore-then-act gate: denies act tools with one-line guidance until evidence lands, clamps the fence narrow-only |
| [`timeout-policy/`](timeout-policy/README.md) | Times out tool calls that declare a limit, so the model gets a clear error instead of waiting forever |
