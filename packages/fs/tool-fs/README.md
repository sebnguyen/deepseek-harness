# @deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-fs

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

Use `dsh-tool-fs` to let a model read UTF-8 files with line numbers, read supported images, and create, replace, or sed-style patch files in one atomic commit. Results are capped, and failures provide stable error codes and recovery instructions. The tool-owned gate already refuses unread whole-file overwrites unless the call passes `overwrite: true` and keeps every commit at an observed or fresh version; add `dsh-fs-observation-policy` for the stricter deployments where even programs require a prior read. Image reads require durable attachment storage and an image-capable routed model. Choose the sibling discovery package for glob or grep searches.

## Use this package

Mount the tools after a `ctx.fs` backend and, for strict read-before-mutation behavior, the policy plugin. The model then gets line-numbered reads, atomic writes and edits, and — with an attachment store mounted — image reads; every result is capped, and failures carry stable codes with recovery instructions.

### Minimal composition

A backend, the policy plugin, then the tools; the attachment store is optional and enables `read_image`.

```yaml
- name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-fs-local'
- name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-fs-observation-policy'
- name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-fs'
```

The tool-owned gate ships inside this package: content writes over unread existing files need the explicit `overwrite` flag, programs always commit at an observed or fresh version, and every mutation records its observation. The policy plugin remains optional and stricter: with it loaded, programs as well as unread content writes refuse until the file was read, and its decision wins the intent slot. `read_image` registers only while a durable `ctx.attachments` service is mounted; execution additionally refuses on a route whose exact model does not declare image input, so a text route's durable history stays free of image blocks.

### The tools

| Tool | Arguments | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `read` | `file_path`, `offset?`, `limit?` | Line-numbered UTF-8 content with a pagination footer; `offset` is 1-based and `limit` defaults to and caps at the configured `readLimit` |
| `read_image` | `file_path` | Reads and persists a PNG/JPEG/WebP/GIF source; an extension-less path (normalized attachment object paths included) is identified from its file signature; normalization can downscale it before the next model request, so the model need not create a thumbnail first |
| `write` | `file_path`, `content?`, `edits?`, `overwrite?`, `dry_run?` | Creates, replaces, or patches in one atomic commit; `edits` entries (literal, regex, line-range, insert) apply sequentially over `content` or the disk text; unread whole-file overwrites need `overwrite: true`; `dry_run` previews without committing |

Field names are snake_case to match Claude Code and existing harness tool schemas. Successes return compact envelopes — a read window, an image reference, or a `Created file`/`Updated file` confirmation — and `write` derives replayable diff-card metadata for UI presentation.

### Configuration

All keys are optional; the defaults are the shipped read caps.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `readLimit` | `2000` | Default and maximum lines returned by one `read` call |
| `readMaxLineLength` | `2000` | Characters kept per line before truncation |
| `readMaxBytes` | `51200` | Byte cap on one `read` call's selected lines; overflow ends the window with a capped footer |
| `readStreamMinSize` | `10485760` | Files at or above this size (or of unknown size) stream instead of loading whole into memory |

The generated [configuration catalog](../../../docs/config-catalog.md#deepseek-aidsh-tool-fs) is the exhaustive source for every accepted field and its JSDoc.

### Policy and sandbox behavior

Path authorization for `read` and `read_image` belongs entirely to `ctx.fs`; media-type declarations and file signatures only decide whether `read_image` accepts the bytes returned by that backend.

The guard rides the single `fs/write-intent` slot: the tool-owned gate decides by default — `FS_OVERWRITE_DENIED` for unread content overwrites without `overwrite`, `FS_STALE_VERSION` on drift — and a loaded policy plugin decides first instead, adding `FS_NOT_OBSERVED` for programs. Under a confining backend (`fs-sandbox`), `write` additionally advertises `sandbox_permissions` and `justification`; a denied mutation returns the `[sandbox: file access denied under <mode> mode]` marker with the same-turn escalation hint, and an approved retry may stamp a strictly wider mode for that one call.

### Failures and recovery

Failures are normalized as `Error: <message>` with a structured code preserved for callers. Stable messages include `file_path must be a non-empty string`, `limit must be less than or equal to <max>`, `cannot read "<path>": not found`, `cannot read "<path>": not a regular file`, and the image-route refusal `cannot read "<path>" as an image: model "<model>" does not declare image input; switch to an image-capable model to read images`. `FS_NOT_OBSERVED` is normalized to `cannot modify "<path>": file has not been read — read the file, then retry` under the strict policy; the default gate's `FS_OVERWRITE_DENIED` is normalized to `cannot overwrite "<path>": not read this session — read it first, or pass overwrite: true`; `FS_STALE_VERSION` retains the provider's reason and appends `— re-read the file, then retry`. After the reread confirms absence, programs report `FS_NOT_FOUND` instead of repeating a stale remedy, while content writes use guarded creation.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

This section explains the design decisions behind the tool suite and points at the code that realizes them; the observable behavior is fully covered in [Use this package](#use-this-package).

### Design concept

The tools are the executor; policy is an event gate. The tools inject no policy service and inspect no cache — each mutation asks the single intent slot for its guard through `ctx.waterfall`, and each operation emits `fs/observed` only after it succeeded. Reads do exactly one provider `stat` (type and size routing plus the observed version); mutations do none, because the guard comes from the intent slot and the provider re-checks under its lock.

### Source map

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| [`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts) | Plugin entry: `Config`, tool composition, `read_image` attachments gate |
| [`src/read.ts`](src/read.ts) | `read` executor: one stat, streaming decision, window build, observation |
| [`src/read-image.ts`](src/read-image.ts) | `read_image` executor: route and media-type gates, bounded bytes, attachment save |
| [`src/write.ts`](src/write.ts) | `write` executor: intent waterfall, atomic write, observation |
| [`src/program.ts`](src/program.ts) | The sed-style engine: entry validation, sequential fold, per-entry match accounting |
| [`src/gate.ts`](src/gate.ts) | Tool-owned default decider over `fs/observed` state; supplies the `fs/write-intent` default |
| [`src/read-render.ts`](src/read-render.ts) | Cordis-free windowing and envelope formatting |
| [`src/sandbox.ts`](src/sandbox.ts) | Escalation API shared by `write`/`edit`: policy resolution and denial-marker mapping |
| [`src/error.ts`](src/error.ts) | Stable model-facing diagnostics for guarded-mutation failures |

### Per-tool flow

All four tools share one flow shape: resolve the path with the calling session's cwd, run the applicable gate, perform exactly one provider operation, and emit `fs/observed` only after success. `read` and `read_image` pay one `stat` for type and size routing; `write` and `edit` pay none because their guard comes from the intent slot, and provider failures surface as typed `FsError` results. The per-tool executors live in `src/read.ts`, `src/read-image.ts`, and `src/write.ts`, with the program engine in `src/program.ts` and the default gate in `src/gate.ts`.

### Observation and concurrency

`fs/observed` fires after the operation succeeded via a plain `ctx.emit`; a listener is contractually a synchronous, side-effect-only recorder, so async or fallible observation does not belong on this event. `read` opts into concurrent scheduling because its only mutation is the synchronous version recorder; recorder races fail closed when a later `write` re-checks the version under its target lock, and the mutation tool remains exclusive.

## Model Experience

### System prompt

#### What the model sees

At assembly time, each guidance section checks `ctx.tools.get(name, scope)` and renders only while its tool is visible to that agent. The single `tool:write` section describes all four sed forms, the overwrite flag, and dry_run. The text below is unchanged when all three tools are available; restrictions, their removal, and tool registration changes take effect on the next assembly. The same check works for direct agent restrictions and subagent `toolFilter`, including PTC capabilities behind `run_code`. The read-before-mutation sentences in write/edit describe the observation policy, not a requirement to invoke the tool named `read`. They remain when `read` is hidden: the policy still guards mutations, and another observing operation, such as `str_replace_editor` with `command: view`, can establish the same file observation. Tool visibility does not disable that precondition.

##### Read guidance

```markdown
Use the read tool — not shell commands like cat — to inspect text files. Results include line numbers. Use offset and limit to continue reading large files.
```

##### Write guidance

```markdown
Use the write tool to create files, replace them whole, or patch them sed-style: pass content for the stream, edits entries (literal, regex, line-range, insert) for hunks applied in one atomic commit, overwrite: true to explicitly clobber a file this session never read, and dry_run to preview without committing.
```

#### Token effect

Guidance cost follows the visible tools and their applicable cross-tool recommendations.

#### KV Cache effect

Prefix-stable while the visible tool set, plugin scope, and guidance text are unchanged. Restrictions or plugin lifecycle changes may invalidate reuse from the first changed section.

### Tool schemas

#### What the model sees

The model sees the generated [`read`, `read_image`, and `write` schemas](../../../docs/tool-catalog.md#deepseek-aidsh-tool-fs), with snake_case arguments. The image tool appears only while a durable attachment store is mounted; its schema is route-independent, and the strict gate refuses at execution. Scoped tool restrictions can remove any definition for one agent.

#### Token effect

Fixed schema cost on every request in that tool view.

#### KV Cache effect

Prefix-stable while the visible tool definitions and order are unchanged. Registration lifecycle or scoped restrictions may invalidate reuse from the first changed schema token.

### Read result

#### What the model sees

A successful read is exactly `<path><displayPath></path>`, newline, `<type>file</type>`, newline, `<content>`, numbered lines as `<lineNumber>: <text>`, a blank line, one footer, and `</content>`. The footer is exactly `(Output capped. Showing lines <start>-<end>. Use offset=<next> to continue.)`, `(Showing lines <start>-<end> of <total>. Use offset=<next> to continue.)`, or `(End of file - total <total> lines)`. A long line ends exactly `... (line truncated to <max> chars)`. A missing read still returns `FS_NOT_FOUND`, but it records confirmed absence for the calling session; after an externally deleted file is re-read, a retried `write` can safely recreate it through the provider's no-replace guard.

#### Token effect

Read output is capped by `readLimit`, `readMaxLineLength`, and `readMaxBytes`; the retained call and result are resent until compaction.

#### KV Cache effect

Append-only; newly visible content follows the reusable request prefix and does not invalidate existing KV-cache entries.

### Image read result

#### What the model sees

A successful `read_image` returns `<path><displayPath></path>`, `<type>image</type>`, and a `<content>` envelope naming the media type, normalized dimensions, and byte size, followed by the image itself as a native image block. The result is logged with its durable reference before the next model request.

#### Token effect

The image is billed on every later request until compaction. Each call is independently bounded by the attachment store's `maxImageBytes`/`maxImagePixels`/`maxImageDimension`; repeated successful calls accumulate history, and content addressing deduplicates only the stored bytes, not the per-request token cost.

#### KV Cache effect

Append-only; newly visible content follows the reusable request prefix and does not invalidate existing KV-cache entries.

### Write results

#### What the model sees

Write returns the exact five-line envelope `<path><displayPath></path>`, `<type>file</type>`, `<content>`, then a one-line outcome (`Created file`, `Updated file`, `Updated file. N edits applied (M matches).`, or the `Dry run — no commit.` wording), then `</content>`. Its structured result also carries per-entry match counts so the model sees what its program did without re-reading. The full write or replacement text remains in the assistant tool-call arguments.

#### Token effect

Success text is small, but large mutation arguments and any result are resent until compaction.

#### KV Cache effect

Append-only; newly visible content follows the reusable request prefix and does not invalidate existing KV-cache entries.

### Tool errors

#### What the model sees

Failures are normalized as `Error: <message>`. This package's stable validation and read messages are `file_path must be a non-empty string`, `limit must be less than or equal to <max>`, `old_string must be a non-empty string`, `old_string and new_string must differ`, `cannot read "<path>": not found`, `cannot read "<path>": not a regular file`, `offset <offset> is out of range for "<path>" (<total> lines)`, `cannot read "<path>": the <ext> extension does not declare a supported image format; read_image accepts PNG/JPEG/WebP/GIF files, including extension-less files in those formats`, `cannot read "<path>": the file content is not a supported image format; read_image accepts PNG/JPEG/WebP/GIF`, `cannot read "<path>": the bytes do not decode as a supported PNG/JPEG/WebP/GIF image; the file may be truncated or corrupt`, `cannot read "<path>" as an image: model "<model>" does not declare image input; switch to an image-capable model to read images`, and the mismatch repair `cannot read "<path>": the <ext> extension declares <type>, but the bytes use a different image format; rename the file to match its actual format if it is PNG/JPEG/WebP/GIF, or convert it to one of those formats` (an extension-less mismatch reports `cannot read "<path>": the file signature claims <type>, but the bytes decode as a different image format; the file may be corrupt`). A failed 16-bit conversion reports `cannot read "<path>": the 16-bit PNG could not be converted to the normalized 8-bit sRGB form; convert it to an 8-bit PNG/JPEG/WebP and retry`. Provider and policy templates are quoted in their package READMEs. The model-facing error wrapper normalizes every `FS_NOT_OBSERVED` source to `cannot modify "<path>": file has not been read — read the file, then retry` (strict policy loaded); `FS_OVERWRITE_DENIED` is normalized to `cannot overwrite "<path>": not read this session — read it first, or pass overwrite: true`; `FS_STALE_VERSION` keeps the provider's reason and adds `— re-read the file, then retry`. All retain the structured error code and original cause. After a reread confirms absence, programs report `FS_NOT_FOUND` instead of a stale remedy, while content writes use guarded creation.

#### Token effect

Only a failing call adds these retained tokens.

#### KV Cache effect

Append-only; newly visible content follows the reusable request prefix and does not invalidate existing KV-cache entries.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits define when the tool suite is a poor fit or needs special operational care. They are current package constraints, not a general filesystem comparison or a task backlog.

- **No model-facing directory listing ships** — `ctx.fs.listDir` serves provider code such as skill discovery, while the sibling `dsh-tool-fs-search` package supplies ripgrep-backed `glob` and `grep` rather than extending the filesystem seam.
- **`read` handles UTF-8 text files only** — images use the separate `read_image` tool; PDF, audio, and video remain deferred. A directory target is `FS_NOT_REGULAR_FILE`.
- **Extension-declared media type** — an extension selects the declared type and the attachment store's magic-byte validation stays authoritative; a correctly formatted image under a wrong extension is refused with the rename remedy rather than sniffed. Only a path with no extension is identified from its file signature.
- **Object paths re-enter source admission** — `read_image` on a normalized attachment object re-admits its bytes as a new source, so a deployment whose `maxImageBytes`/`maxMessageImageBytes` sit below the normalized-image byte budget can refuse an object path that `ctx.attachments.readImage` still serves; shipped defaults keep the normalized budget (4 MiB) far under the source caps (20 MiB).
- **Inline image preview rides the UI composition** — the tool-result card renders the image through the browser's `tool.call.images` slot, which the attachment presentation plugin fills; a UI without that plugin shows the result's envelope text instead.
- **No attachment-region tool** — an agent may crop an image through another available tool when it has a filesystem path; a pasted or dragged image without a path cannot be re-read at higher resolution.
- **No timeout surface** — `read`/`write`/`edit` take no timeout argument and declare no timeout budget; cancellation rides `exec.signal` only ([provider rationale](../README.md)).
