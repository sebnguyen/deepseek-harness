# @deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-chat

## Summary

Use this package to render a browser chat from recorded Session conversations, including historical images, localized actions, and restored scroll position. Each assistant Step renders as a span whose reasoning, Tool, retry, and message rows stand inline between the Step's boundary rows. Local transcript and steering submissions appear immediately, remain in their original surface, and disappear atomically when authoritative Session records arrive, while queued submissions stay outside Chat. The package does not assemble or modify model requests.

File-mention providers receive the viewed Session ID with the closing-turn owner, so links into inherited history can address the fork itself.

## Reference previews

Sent file references and skills confirmed by the message’s logged invocation open in the right Sidebar. File paths use the viewed Session; skill names resolve through its current input-trigger source. Both use the prose file-link dotted underline on hover or focus. Sessions, directories, and command labels remain non-navigating references.

<a id="system-prompt-row"></a>
## System prompt row

Each nonempty appended `system/message` owns a collapsed prompt row, including a complete prompt at the start of a headerless window; the same-step header does not duplicate it. Chat also shows a collapsed `System prompt` row for a non-empty initial request, explicit message-series start, or `system/message` surface node replacement whose text differs, reading the last nonempty surviving system node in surface order at the `request/header`; a non-initial request whose preceding header is outside the loaded history window also shows one. A resume repeats the row even when its system text is unchanged, including after pagination supplies the preceding header and system node; same-series config-only or tool-only changes, tool steps, and retries create no repetition, and a `system/message` event is never rendered as a transcript message. The row appears before that request's user messages, matching the provider envelope, and expands to the exact model-visible text with its original line breaks. A request whose system node is empty or outside the loaded window creates no row until the page holding the node arrives.

<a id="turn-token-usage"></a>
## Turn token usage

A completed Turn shows an expandable usage row when the loaded window includes `turn/start` and every reporting model attempt carries safe, exact usage. The row omits unavailable optional buckets, and a turn whose attempts settled without a usage sample shows its reported subtotal with that attempt count in the dialog. Missing lifecycle evidence or contradictory accounting hides the disclosure instead of presenting a partial total.

<a id="completed-turn-footer"></a>
## Completed-turn footer

The completed-turn action footer starts 20px below the preceding prose or extension content.

<a id="scroll-ownership"></a>
## Scroll ownership

Chat restores semantic anchors across history prepend and renderer remounts. Pinned scroll deliveries without reader movement update follow ownership immediately, before subsequent layout changes can invalidate their floor. Reader movement remains pending until the sampling interval or `scrollend`, even inside the follow threshold, so layout growth cannot erase small scroll gestures. While the reader is pinned to the floor, `ResizeObserver` follows the new floor and selects the latest loaded Turn without reading row geometry. Once the reader moves away, flow-height changes preserve the top position and the reading-line geometry selects the active Turn. Turn-rail previews paint above sticky Markdown code-block banners, while the rail frame remains inside the transcript band above the composer.

<a id="model-experience"></a>
## Model Experience

None, as this package renders logged conversation state in the browser and registers nothing model-facing.

#### KV Cache effect

None; Chat presentation does not assemble or mutate provider requests.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- **The transcript reflects the loaded Session window** — older transcript nodes become available only after Session Controller loads the preceding event page. Turn navigation is wider than the window: the rail merges the loaded Turns with the host `turnOutline` projection, so every started Turn gets a fixed-pitch mark (10px apart; a ladder taller than the frame scrolls inside it with gradient fades), and activating an unloaded mark pages history through the Turn's `turn/start` seq before landing on its row. Without the projection (assemblies not mounting `dsh-session-turn-outline`) the rail falls back to loaded Turns only.
- **Rail previews are card-sized** — one prompt line (50 characters) and up to three response lines (120), on loaded and unloaded Turns alike; an unloaded Turn's response arrives from the outline only once the Turn settled, so an open Turn previews its prompt (or just the Turn number) until then.

**Runtime invariant:** No companion is published. Conversation and Slot registration enforce Chat target consistency.
